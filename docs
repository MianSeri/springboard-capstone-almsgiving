Project Title: AlmsGiving Lite — Donation & Campaign Tracker for Nonprofits

1. Project Overview
AlmsGiving Lite is a full-stack web application designed to help small nonprofits create and manage donation campaigns. Many smaller community organizations do not have access to expensive fundraising software, so this project will offer an easy way for them to track donations, share campaigns, and view basic analytics. Donors will also be able to browse campaigns and submit “mock donations” to show support.
This project will allow me to demonstrate everything I’ve learned in the bootcamp, including React, Node, Express, MongoDB, APIs, authentication, and building a dynamic user interface.

2. Tech Stack
Frontend: React (with React Router for navigation)
Backend: Node.js + Express (custom API routes and authentication)
Database: MongoDB / Mongoose
Hosting:
Frontend: Netlify or Vercel (Firebase/cloudFare not sure I’m still researching)
Backend: Render, Railway, or Heroku
Database: MongoDB Atlas
I chose this stack because it follows in some degree the curriculum, and it will allow me to build a real full-stack app with a clean separation between frontend and backend.

3. Project Focus
This will be an evenly focused full-stack application.
The frontend will handle the user experience (dashboards, forms, browsing campaigns).
The backend will store all the data (campaigns, nonprofits, donations) with secure routes and authentication.
Both sides are equally important for this project.

4. Project Type
This will be a responsive website that works on both desktop and mobile browsers. The UI is simple enough that a mobile app isn’t required at this stage.

5. Project Goal
The main goal of Alms Lite is to give nonprofits a simple way to manage donation campaigns. They will be able to log in, create campaigns, share their links, and see how many donations they received.
Donors can browse campaigns and submit a mock donation amount to show support (this is not a real payment system).
The goal is not to replace real donation platforms, but to show how a donation management system works behind the scenes.

6. Users
There are two types of users:
1. Nonprofit Staff
Small charities
Community groups
School clubs
Church groups
Individuals running donation drives
They need:
A dashboard
Campaign creation forms
A place to track donation activity
2. Donors
Anyone supporting a nonprofit’s cause
Students
Families
Community members
They need:
Campaign browsing
Ability to submit a mock donation
A simple “Thank you” confirmation

7. Data and API Plan
Data that will be stored:
Nonprofit accounts (name, email, password, logo)
Campaigns (title, description, goal amount, image, start date, end date)
Donations (name, amount, timestamp, optional message)
Where the data will come from:
I will primarily build my own API using Node + Express.
The API will store and retrieve all information from MongoDB.
Optional:
A currency conversion API (free)
An email API to send donation confirmations
At this stage, I only need to outline the kind of data the app will use, not the final external API choice.

8. Project Approach
This section breaks down how I plan to build the app.
1. Database Schema (Draft)
Users (Nonprofits): name, email, passwordHash, logo
Campaigns: title, description, goalAmount, amountRaised, image, nonprofitId
Donations: donorName, amount, message, campaignId, createdAt
2. API Considerations
Need to protect routes using JWT
Donation totals must update correctly
Campaigns belong to specific nonprofits
No real payment data (mock only)
Must avoid exposing private info
3. Sensitive Information
Passwords must be hashed
Donor names/messages treated as private
No credit card or actual payment data is used

9. App Functionality
Nonprofit Features
Sign up and login
Create/edit/delete campaigns
Upload a campaign image
Dashboard showing:
Total donations
Recent donors
Progress toward fundraising goal
Donor Features
Browse all public campaigns
View campaign details
Submit a mock donation
Receive a “thank you” confirmation
General Features
Routing for different pages
Form validation
Loading states
Simple analytics (charts or progress bars)

10. User Flow
Nonprofit User Flow
Sign up or log in
Land on dashboard
Create a new campaign
Share campaign link
View donations and progress
Edit or end campaign
Donor User Flow
Visit homepage
Browse campaigns
Select one
Submit a mock donation
See confirmation message

11. Features Beyond CRUD
To ensure this is more than just a Create/Read/Update/Delete app, I will include:
A donation analytics dashboard
A real-time progress bar
Activity feed of most recent donors
Auto-generated mock receipt
Campaign sharing link
Search and filter features
These features make the app feel more like a real nonprofit tool rather than a simple database project.

12. Stretch Goals
If time allows, I may add:
Email receipts via SendGrid
Multi-currency donations using a conversion API
Donor login system
PDF receipt generator
QR codes for campaigns
Recurring donations (mock)
